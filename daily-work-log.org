   + What is the task I was assigned today?
   Today was about familiarizing ourselves with shell commands, version control and Emacs. 
   + What did I get done against each task?
   I installed softwares and packages to set up our laptops. This helped me review the basic 
   shell commands. I was then taught the basics of Git (version control) and I later applied
   this in creating my repository for the internship. Finally, I was taught the basic structure 
   of emacs and I played around with it, learning some of its commands and functionalities.
